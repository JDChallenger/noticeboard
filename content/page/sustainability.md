* Sustainable aviation seminar by Dr Sebastian Eastham

Sebastian Eastham is Senior Lecturer in Sustainable Aviation in the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial, and a member of the Brahmal Vasudevan Institute for Sustainable Research. His research is focused on advancing our understanding of the impacts of aerospace emissions on the environment so that we can quantify and reduce them. This includes using modelling and remote sensing to investigate how the ozone layer, climate, and global air pollution are affected by aircraft emissions, and how future changes in technology or policy might allow us to keep expanding our access to the world without bringing the same environmental harm.

This talk will discuss the different environmental impacts which result from flying, and how new technologies and policies seek to address them. It will also discuss why three short flights can be worse than one long flight, how a flight from New York to LA makes pollution worse in London, and why it might be better (for the climate) to fly during the summer than the winter.

## Collaborative walking map

We have a collaborative map for adding local walks (see also upcoming social events) [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1O02gu50Osnt5kS7H4uWR4uXC8CwERgI&usp=sharing). You can view this on a computer but you can add your own walks if you open it on your mobile.
