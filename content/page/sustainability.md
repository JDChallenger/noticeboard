## Collaborative walking map

We have a collaborative map for adding local walks (see also upcoming social events) [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1O02gu50Osnt5kS7H4uWR4uXC8CwERgI&usp=sharing). You can view this on a computer but you can add your own walks if you open it on your mobile.
